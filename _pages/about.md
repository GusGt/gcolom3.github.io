Escape the Dungeon
- Platform based game
- Play5
- Analog gameplay
- Physical meters

Components:
- Arduino Board x1
- LED lights x3
- analog joy stick x1
- button x1
- wires

Initial Ideas:
- side scroller platforming game
- escape by always going to the right
- wanted to base off the metroidvania style
- Sound for gameplay features, shooting, coins, boss projectiles, etc
- Analog controls (i.e. joystick)
- Graphics, using sprites and tile sets for world generation

Description
======
Dungeon Escape is a platform game requiring players to traverse the obstacles and enemies. The player finds themselves stuck in a cave/dungeon, presumably from falling into a hole. Their main goal, escaping and seeing the sun once again. Aside from falling to their death, there are living enemies keen on protecting their home and will not surrender to the player. However, greed persists always, COINS are all over the dungeon, who in their right mind would just leave a pile of gold coins around in a cave! Something is up, there seems to be a malicious aura at the end of the dungeon, facing it is unavoidable. You must escape, your life can not end here. 

Future Development
======
There was a couple of things I did want to implement but could not fit into 
the scope due to the amount of time left. For example, more levels is defintely a must as only three could lead to some very quick clears that makes games boring. There was also the case of giving the boss a special attack as his attack to me becomes very predictable. Perhaps an attack where several projectiles are unleased at once spanning to different corners randomly forcing the player to start traversing more. Power ups were a stretch feature I was not able to implement. I believe power ups make games much more entertaining, giving players a sense of progress as their characters get stronger or faster.
